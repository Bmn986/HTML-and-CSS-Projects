            <h3>This is  where i test all the cool things i learned</h3>
                <p>Between HTML , JavaScript and CSS i feel like i have the ability to do many things</p>

            <p>I'm excited to see what i learn next even just learning how and where to look for the knowledge for myself is valuable.</p>
                <h3>Career in Tech?</h3>    
                <p>If doing things like build webpages, work with others towards a common goal, and always being a part of the cutting 
                    edge advancements constantly pushing the human race forward. COUNT ME IN!! I would also get a livable wage that allows me
                to take care of my family, and not have to stress. I'm never going to work in another industry again!  </p>
            <h3>Seriously</h3>    
            <p>Seriously though im thrilled to have learned the things that I've learned thus far, and very excited for what is coming up.
                Not just in this Bootcamp but what i have coming up for life after this.
